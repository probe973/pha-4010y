<li>A <strong>{{include.q.mass}} kg</strong> patient requires <strong>{{include.q.rate}} mg/kg/minute</strong> for <strong>{{include.q.time}} minutes</strong>, delivered by a <strong>{{include.q.conc}} %w/v</strong> solution. How much solution will they need in ml?
    <p>Test: The calculated volume is {{ volume }} ml.</p>
