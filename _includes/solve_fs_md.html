Formula for a solution is:<br>
Substance A: {{include.q.A}} mg<br>
Substance B: {{include.q.B}} ml<br>
Water to : {{include.q.W}} ml<br>
<br>
How much of each substance is required to make {{include.q.NW}} ml of the solution?

      <p>You need to make less of the substance than the formula shows.</p>
      <p>Step 1: How many times less?</p>
